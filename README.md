Before I share my skills and abilities with you, let me tell you a few things about myself.
My name is Nika, and I'm a junior front-end developer from Tbilisi, Georgia. First and foremost, I adore coding and have always wished to become a programmer
For now I'm trying to be disciplined and learn new things every day. To tell you about my education, I am a second-year student at Georgian Technical University. 
I'm currently taking Rs School training, which is giving me new experiences. 
Aside from that, I also learn front and web development through the internet using various platforms such as pluralsight.
Everything I've learned has come from this source. Now it's time to tell you about my First Steps in Programming, including how and when I began learning to code. 
As I previously stated, I have always been attracted by this profession, but my first exposure to it occurred when I graduated from high school. 
I didn't know how to start programming at first, but a my friend helped me figure it out, and I began learning the fundamentals of web development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
When I understood the basics of how a web page is built, I went on to explore in depth how JavaScript works. 
After that, if I wanted to be a successful front end developer, I had to learn and select one of the JavaScript frameworks, and I chose react. 
I haven't stopped learning new things in all this time, and I intend to continue doing so. 
My long-term goals are to become an experienced front-end developer, as well as to learn back-end and become a full-stack.During this course, the most serious project I've ever encountered was an e-commerce web app with products page, product page, and cart features. 
For me, the most difficult issue was to develop a logic that should add a product to the cart with using a drag and drop functionality.
I've also worked on several projects, including designing responsive websites, and the key challenge throughout this project was to create a screen adaptive website without using any CSS framework or a library.
